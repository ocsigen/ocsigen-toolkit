(** [make ?action ?round_5 ?h24 ()] produces a clock-style time picker
    for hours and minutes. The user is first asked to pick hours, then
    minutes with a separate clock.

    If [action] is provided, it is called when a new time is
    available.

    [init] (if provided) is the default displayed time.

    [update] is a React event that can be used to trigger updates from
    outside.

    If [round_5] is true (default: false), the output for the minutes
    is rounded to multiples of 5.

    If [h24] is true (default: true), a 24-hour hour picker is
    used.

    The first part of the output is the clock. The second part of the
    output is a reactive signal [(h, m)] where [h] are the hours and
    [m] the minutes that the user picked. The third part of the output
    is a function that can be called to go back to hours selection. *)
