val nodeready : #Dom.node Js.t -> unit Lwt.t
(** Wait for a node to be inserted in the DOM.

    {3 Example}

    [let _ = nodeready node in Console.console##debug node]

    {3 Known issues}

    Using it on a node that is never actually added in the DOM will
    make the node and the thread wakener kept in memory.  Also, note
    that nodeready is fired only once (except if you add a new
    listener to it after triggering the first one). *)
