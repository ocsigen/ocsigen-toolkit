(** [ popup ?a ?enable_scrolling_hack
       ?close_button ?confirmation_onclose ?onclose gen_content ]
    Display a modal popup.
    Returns the popup container, in case you need it.

    [enable_scrolling_hack] (default: [true]) toggle the hack setting
    popup background (body) to [fixed] when popups open

    Use [close_button] if you want to add a button to close the popup.

    [confirmation_on_close] is used to ask confirmation to the user
    when closing the popup with the close button. Only relevant if
    one of [close_button], [close_on_background_click], [close_on_escape]
    is supplied.

    [onclose] is a hook called just after the popup has been actually closed.

    [gen_content] is a function taking the function closing the popup as
    parameter, and returning the popup content.

    If [close_on_background_click] (default: false) is true then clicking on the
    background of the popup closes it.

    If [close_on_escape] (default: true if [close_button] is supplied) then
    hitting the escape key will close the popup.
