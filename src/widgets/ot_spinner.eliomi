(** Spinner widget *)

(** On client side, [with_spinner th] returns immediately a spinner
    while Lwt thread [th] is not finished, that will automatically
    be replaced by the result of [th] when finished.
    It has class "spinning" while the spinner is present.

    On server side, it will wait for [th] to be finished before
    returning its result (and never display a spinner). *)
