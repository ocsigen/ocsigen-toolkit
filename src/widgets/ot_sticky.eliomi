(** position:sticky polyfill which is not supported by some browsers. It
    functions by making a clone with position:fixed of the designated
    element and continuously (window scroll/resize) monitoring the
    position of the element and the clone. The contents of the element
    is shifted back and forth between the two elements. Make sure to
    also apply the CSS code "position: sticky" to the element as this
    function has no effect if "position: sticky" is supported by the
    browser. The supplied element should be a D-element.
    [dir] determines whether it sticks to the top on vertical scroll or the the
    left on horizontal scroll.

    NOTE: Do not forget to include the CSS attributes as defined in the file
    css/ot_sticky.css.

    If [?force] is [true], will apply the polyfill even if the browser supports
    sticky position (default is [false]).

(** make sure an element gets never out of sight while scrolling by
    continuously (window scroll/resize) monitoring the position of the
    element and adjusting the top/left value. Calls
    [make_sticky]. Make sure to also apply the CSS code "position:
    sticky" to the element. The element's absolute position is
    determined by the parents position (which is not sticky but
    inline), so you probably want to wrap your element in a dedicated
    div. (It has to be the parent and not the element itself because
    when the element floats (is in its fixed state) we can't use its
    position for computing the right values.  Returns a function by
    which the [keep_in_sight] functionality can be stopped. *)
