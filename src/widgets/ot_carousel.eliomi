(** {2 Carousel}

    This is a widget containing blocks. One or several blocks are
    displayed at a time, depending on the size of the carousel. User
    can display the next/previous items by pressing buttons, by
    swiping on touch screens, or by pressing arrow keys.

    It is possible to put a carousel inside another carousel.

    A carousel can be horizontal or vertical.

    This module also defines two other widgets related to the carousel:

    - bullets displays the current position in the carousel (as a set
      of bullets),

    - ribbon: display a swipeable horizontal menu to navigate the
      carousel.

    You can use all these widgets in client or server OCaml side
    programs. *)

(**
  Creates a carousel from the elements of a list.
    [?position] is the initial position (default 0).
    [?update] is a react event you can use to command the carousel from outside.
    [?disabled] is always [false] by default. When [true], it is not possible
    to change carousel position.
    [?transition_duration] allows to adjust the
    transition duration (which is currently constant). Default is 0.6s.
    [?inertia] makes it possible to reduce (or increase) inertia.
    Default is [1.0]. No inertia is [0.0].
    [?allow_overswipe] is [false] by default. It [true], it is possible to
    swipe before first page and after last page.

    Use optional parameter [?full_height]
    if you don't want scroll bars in carousel
    pages. Carousel will expand as necessary in the page, and swiping
    to another page will automatically update the scroll position of the
    whole page. Use this for example if you want a page with several tabs.
    [`No_header] means that the top of the screen will be used for the
    default position. Use [`Header f] if you want to add some extra space
    for a header (for example a tabbar). [f] is the function which returns
    the height of this header.

    Optional parameter [?make_transform] makes it possible to
    customize the transformation applied to the carousel when it moves.
    The default is a translation, but you may want for example a rotation
    for a circular carousel. Function [make_transform] takes [~vertical]
    (whether the carousel is vertical or horizontal), the current move
    ([?delta], in pixels) if the carousel is currently being
    dragged using fingers on touch screens, and the current position
    (before starting moving the carousel if it is currently being dragged).
    It must return the CSS value of the [transform] property for the
    page container (which has class ["car2"]).

    Optional parameter [?make_page_attribute] allows to add html attributes
    to each page of the carousel. It takes the page number as parameter.

    Function [make] returns:
    - the element,
    - the current position (as a react signal),
    - the number of visible elements. It is more than 1 if element width
    ([div.car2]) is set, in CSS, to a value smaller than carousel width
    (for example 50% or 33.33%).
    The width of all elements is supposed to be equal,
    and the size of carousel must be a multiple of the size of element.
    - the current swipe position. Value -1.0 corresponds to previous page,
    and +1.0 to next page.

(** Carousel with 3D effect. Faces are displayed on a cylinder.
    Give the number of faces you want as parameter [faces] (default: 20).
    The size of the faces (height for vertical carousel, width for horizontal)
    must be given as parameter [face_size]
    and must match the size given in the CSS (in pixel, default is 25).
    This carousel is vertical by default.

    Function [make] returns:
    - the element,
    - the current position (as a react signal),
    - the current swipe position. Value -1.0 corresponds to previous page,
    and +1.0 to next page.

(** List of bullets for carousel. Current page has class ["active"].
    [pos] is a signal corresponding to current position.
    [change] is a function to change position of carousel.
    This is usually the function to trigger the event given as
    parameter to [make].
    [length] must be exactly the number of elements in the carousel.
    Optional parameter [attributes] makes possible to give an HTML attribute
    to each bullet (for example a reactive class).
    Optional parameter [size] is the number of elements visible at the same time
    in the carousel (return by function [make]).
    Optional parameter [content] makes it possible to fill the bullets with Html
    elements.

(** Menu (or tabs) for carousel. Current page has class ["active"].
    [pos] is a signal corresponding to current position.
    [change] is a function to change position of carousel.
    This is usually the function to trigger the event given as
    parameter to [make].
    Optional parameter [size] is the number of elements visible at the same time
    in the carousel (return by function [make]).
    Optional parameter [gap] is the default gap on the left, in pixels.
    The last argument is the list of titles, for each carousel page,
    that will be included in [<li>] tags.

    If [cursor] is present, an element is added below the ribbon
    to visualize the current position. It corresponds to the float
    signal returned by [make].
