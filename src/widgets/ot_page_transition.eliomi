(** The type of animation. [Nil] means there is no animation.
    [Forward] means going forward in history or loading a new page.
    Normally we will see a page come from the right side and cover
    the current page. [Backward] means going backward in history. In
    this case, the current page moves to the right side in order to
    display the page covered by it. *)

(** Suppose that screenshots are stored in objects of type [screenshot].
    Users need to provide a module which specifies the type screenshot
    (e.g. string) and a function [screenshot_container] that creates
    a html element from the screenshot.

(** [install_global_handler t take_screenshot animation_type]
    creates a global onchangepage handler which is registered
    recursively and applies to all pages. [t] is the transition duration
    of the animation. [take_screenshot callback] takes a screenshot
    of the current page and then calls [callback]. A callback function
    is used here because [take_screenshot] is usually asynchronous.
    [animation_type ev] decides the type of the animation of page
    transition in an onchangepage event.

    TODO: we can avoid the callback function by transforming
    [take_screenshot] to a function of type [unit -> screenshot Lwt.t]*)

    are stored as a data uri. *)
