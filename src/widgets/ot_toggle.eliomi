(** [make ?init_up ?up_txt ?down_txt ()] produces a binary toggle. If
    [init_up] is true, the toggle is originally up (default: down). The
    buttons for the "up" and "down" positions are marked with [up_txt]
    and [down_txt]. The first part of the output is the toggle, and the
    second part is a Boolean reactive signal, where true means "up". *)
