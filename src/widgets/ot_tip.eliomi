(** {2 Tip widget} *)

(** This module implement a [display] function which actually display a tip
    (i.e. a box over the page content).

    It appends an element (which is called here "the filter") to body. The filter is
    meant take the whole page space, in order to capture clicks to close the tip.
    The filter also contains another element, called the menu which is the container
    for content to be displayed.

    [filter_a]: filter attributes default is [ a_class ["ot-drp-filter"] ]
    and will be overriden if you provide this argument.

    [menu_a]: menu attributes default is [ [ a_class ["ot-drp-menu"] ] ]
    and will be overriden if you provide this argument.

    [position]: specify how the tip whould be positioned horizontally with respect
    to the [origin] element. By default, the tip is above the [origin] element
    when there is more space above than below the [origin] element and vice versa.
    When position is [`Forced_top] or [`Forced_bottom], the tip is always
    above (resp. the below) the [origin] element.
    When position is [`Top] or [`Bottom], the tip is above (resp. the below)
    the [origin] element unless the tip is off the screen and in this case
    the tip will be below (resp. the above) the [origin] element.
    When position is [`Ratio r], the tip is below the [origin] element if
    the [origin] element is on the top [r] part of the screen otherwise the tip
    will be above the [origin] element.

    [side]: specify how the tip whould be positioned vertically with respect to
    the [origin] element. By default, the tip is centered; if it would
    not fit on screen, its right hand side or left hand side is aligned
    with the middle of the [origin] element. When side is [`Left] or
    [`Right], the tip and the [origin] element are aligned on the
    right (resp. the left).

    [origin] is the element from which the tip is supposed to pop out.

    [onopen filter menu side] is called after the filter is append to body.

    [onclose filter menu side] is called after the tip has been closed.

    [content] is the function generating the main content. It takes the function
    to close the tip as parameter
