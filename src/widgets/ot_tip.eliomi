    (i.e. a box over the page content).

    It appends an element (which is called here "the filter") to body. The filter is
    meant take the whole page space, in order to capture clicks to close the tip.
    The filter also contains another element, called the menu which is the container
    for content to be displayed.

    and will be overriden if you provide this argument.

    [menu_a]: menu attributes default is [ [ a_class ["ot-drp-menu"] ] ]
    and will be overriden if you provide this argument.

    [onopen filter menu side] is called after the filter is append to body.

    [onclose filter menu side] is called after the tip has been closed.

    [content] is the function generating the main content. It takes the function
    to close the tip as parameter
