(** {2 Get an event when an element's size changes}

    {3 Known issues}

    This only work with elements in the DOM (maybe that the element
    has to be displayd, need to check this).  In case of a content
    loaded dynamically with js, watch a parent already thereif
    possible or use a [onnodeready] event to attach [noderesize]
    listener.

    Also, if the element is removed, then re-inserted in the DOM, sensor
    will not work anymore.

    If the element to be watched is not positionned, a [position:
    relative] will be applied.

    {3 Example}

    {[Lwt.async (fun () ->
        let div' = (To_dom.of_element div) in
        let%lwt () = Ot_nodeready.nodeready div' in
        Ot_noderesize.noderesize (ot_noderesize.attach div) (fun () ->
          Firebug.console##log (Js.string "Resized") ) )]} *)

type resize_sensor

val attach : #Dom_html.element Js.t -> resize_sensor

(** When [safe] is set to [true], [noderesize] will work whatever sized is
    the watched element. When set to [false] (which is the default),
    elements bigger than 9999px (width or height) will not detect resize,
    but noderesize will be more efficient (less computation/reading). *)
val noderesize : ?safe:bool -> resize_sensor -> (unit -> unit) -> unit

val detach : resize_sensor -> unit
