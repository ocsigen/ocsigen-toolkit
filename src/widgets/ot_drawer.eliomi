(** Build a drawer menu on the left, right, top or bottom of the screen.
    Returns the DOM element, and functions to open and close the menu.
    It is also possible to open or close the menu by clicking on a button,
    and to swipe the menu to close it.

    If [opened] is true (false by default), the drawer is initialized in its
    opened state.

    If [swipe] is true (default), the user can swipe to open or close the
    drawer.

    If present, function [onclose] is called just after the drawer is closed,
    and function [onopen] just before it starts opening.

    [wrap_close] and [wrap_open] can be used to customize calls to [close] and
    [open_] functions when the drawer closing or opening is triggered. For
    example, drawer closing can be disabled using [wrap_close].
